 <h2>What I'm currently working on</h2>

 <h3>Punch Time Management</h3>
 <p>Punch is a fullstack application that simplifies the process of submitting time cards and handling HR tasks for small companies. Time cards and their details are stored in a SQL database using a RESTful API written in C#, admin users of the app are able to apply filters to the data set and create simple reports for tracking employee hours, work tasks and time off requests. Punch's front end is a SPA(Single Page Application) built using React for a snappy user experience.</p>
